# SessionsandUserRegistration
This PHP project is similar to the other user registration project, except it uses sessions instead of cookies to track user activity.

Download Interface with User Reg and Sessions

Now repeat the assignment from the previous project, only this time, instead of cookies use sessions.
Since sessions are being used, it is unnecessary to have the seven day limit from the previous assignment. 
However, users should only be able to download the file once per session.
